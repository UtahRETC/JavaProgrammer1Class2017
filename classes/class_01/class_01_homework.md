### Write the following programs

---

#### Hello

Write a program that prints "Hello, my name is Marcos". Just make sure to use your name instead of mine.

---

#### Operators

The program below is displaying the results for the result of a `>` operator. Do the same for the rest of the operators we covered in class.

The example below declared a variable and prints out the result in a human friendy way. You should do the same for the operators that you use. For example, when you add the `<` operator, declare a variable the holds the result and add a print statement detailing what was checked and what the result is.

```java
public class Operators {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    boolean is5GreaterThan5 = 5 > 5;

    System.out.println("Is 5 greater than 5? " + is5GreaterThan5);
  }
}
```
